/**
 * Fill the local emulator with a plausible event, so the whole day can be
 * rehearsed without touching the real project.
 *
 * This talks ONLY to the emulator, and refuses to run any other way. Two
 * deliberate choices enforce that:
 *
 *   - the project id is pinned to `demo-ideathon`, which the emulator treats as
 *     fully offline, and
 *   - every database write carries `Authorization: Bearer owner`, a credential
 *     that exists only in the emulator.
 *
 * There is no --apply flag and no production code path. Seeding a live event
 * with fake teams is not a thing anyone should be one typo away from.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run emulators                  # in one terminal
 *   npm run seed                       # in another
 *   npm run start:emulator             # the app, pointed at the emulator
 *
 * Options:
 *   --teams=10 --judges=12 --rooms=10 --batches=3
 *   --scores        also file first-round score cards, so the final round and
 *                   the standings can be exercised straight away
 *   --schedule      also generate the first-round schedule
 *   --password=...  the password every seeded account shares (default: testtest)
