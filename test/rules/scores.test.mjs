/**
 * /scores — the node this whole restructure exists for.
 *
 * Scores used to live under teams/{id}/scores. Realtime Database rules cascade
 * and cannot be revoked deeper, so the read a team member holds on their own
 * team granted everything beneath it: every judge's numbers and their free-text
 * notes. The first block below is the regression test for that, checked at all
 * four levels of the path because a cascade bug shows up at exactly one of them.
