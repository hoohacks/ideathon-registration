/**
 * The last hour of the event: cutting the finalists, correcting the plan, and
 * publishing it — then reading the result off a screen instead of a spreadsheet.
 *
 * Every piece of this is new enough to be worth driving end to end. The planner
 * replaced a modal that derived everything at the moment of the write; the
 * results page replaced no page at all, because the standings were written and
 * never read.
 *
 * The final round ranks on first-round averages, so this seeds those itself
 * rather than depending on whichever spec ran before it.
