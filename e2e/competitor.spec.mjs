/**
 * The competitor journey, and the reason this whole layer exists.
 *
 * `joinTeam` read `submitted` and `members` before letting anyone in. Neither is
 * readable by a non-member -- which is precisely who is joining -- so the read
 * rejected, the catch fired, and every join in the app returned "Could not join
 * that team. Please try again." Retrying could never work.
 *
 * Every unit test mocks the database, so no test above this one could see it.
 * This spec joins a team as a real signed-in user against the real rules.
