 *   competitors/{uid}/teamId     = teamId    what the app routes on
 *
 * These used to be written as two sequential `set()` calls. If the second one
 * failed -- a dropped connection on venue wifi is the normal case, not the
 * exotic one -- the person ended up a member of a team the app would not route
 * them to, and the create screen would happily let them make a second one. The
 * admin-side equivalent, moveCompetitorToTeam, already got this right with a
 * single multi-path update; this is the same fix for the three flows a
 * competitor actually uses.
 *
 * Realtime Database applies a multi-path update atomically and checks each path
 * against its own rule, both of which a competitor already holds.

 * So there is no server-side cap, and someone working from the console can
 * exceed it. It stops the ordinary path, which is what it is for.
 *
 * The closed-after-submission limit below IS enforced in the rules, because
