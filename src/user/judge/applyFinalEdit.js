/**
 * The things an organizer can change about a final round, before it is real.
 *
 * `applyEdit.js` for the final round. Same contract: pure, returns a new plan,
 * never mutates the one it was given, appends a summary to `edits` so the
 * publish can list what was changed by hand and `undoFinalEdit` can walk back.
 *
 * The refusals are different, because the round is. There is one room, so no
 * edit can put a judge in two places at once and no op refuses on a clash. What
 * it does refuse is a judge scoring the same team twice: whoever marked a team
 * in round one is excluded from its final panel, and adding them back is a
 * mistake rather than an override.
