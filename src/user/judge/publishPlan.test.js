/**
 * publishPlan end to end, with the database mocked.

 * publishPlan is the writer half of the plan/publish split: planSchedule
 * builds a plan with no writes, and this is the one place that replaces every
 * judge and team assignment in a live event. What is worth pinning is the
 * order (restore point before schedule), the refusal to write anything on
 * drift or an empty/unjudged plan, and that the payload actually written
 * matches what the plan decided.
