/**
 * What moved since a plan was built.
 *
 * A plan is a snapshot: `planSchedule` reads the world once and hands back a
 * draft an organizer can hand-edit before anything is published. Time passes
 * between that read and the publish -- a team submits, a judge goes home, a
 * room floods -- and publishing on the old snapshot would write a schedule
 * that is quietly wrong: a team with no slot, a judge on a card who is no
 * longer eligible.
 *
 * `checkDrift` is the comparison. It never touches the database -- it takes
 * the fingerprint the plan was built from (`basis`), the same shape read
 * fresh (`live`), and the plan itself, and sorts what changed into two piles:
 *
 *   blocking  -- the plan is now wrong, not merely stale. Each item carries a
 *                `repair`, a targeted fix an organizer can apply instead of
 *                rebuilding and losing their hand edits.
 *   advisory  -- shown, but the plan still publishes fine as it stands.
 *
 * `readLiveBasis` is the only half of this file that reads the database. It
 * has to shape teams and judges exactly as `planSchedule` does -- same
 * `submitted` filter, same `isRound1Judge` and `checkedIn` filters, the same
 * `displayName` -- or drift would fire on a difference that was never real,
 * just two places naming things differently.
