 * The shape of the final round, decided before anything is written.
 *
 * This is to `finalRoundService` what `schedulePlan` is to `planSchedule`: the
 * arithmetic, with no Firebase in it, so the answer is available before the
 * write and testable without an emulator.
 *
 * Two things drive the whole file.
 *
 * 1. **One room, teams in sequence.** The final round is not a second first
 *    round. Every finalist presents to the same panel, one after another, so
 *    there is no "judge in two rooms at once" to check for -- there is one
 *    room. What an organizer edits is who is on a panel, and what order the
 *    teams go in.
 *
 * 2. **A judge does not mark the same team twice.** Whoever scored a team in
 *    round one is excluded from its final panel, and the edit layer refuses to
 *    add them back. That exclusion is per team, not per judge: a judge barred
 *    from one finalist is usually fine for the other three.
