/**
 * Builds the first round judging schedule as a plan, without writing it.
 *
 * Teams are split into batches that each present at a different time. Within a
 * batch every team gets its own room, and every judge is sent to at most one
 * team per batch, so no judge is ever double booked.
 *
 * Returns { ok, error, warnings, advice, plan }. It never throws, and it
 * issues no writes -- the plan it returns is handed to a separate publish
 * step, so an organizer can see and hand-edit a schedule before anything is
 * saved.
 *
 * `onlyCheckedIn` restricts the pool to judges who have actually arrived.
 * Check-in state used to be ignored entirely, so a judge who never turned up
 * still got a third of the rooms and the teams they were sent to went unseen,
 * with nothing anywhere reporting it.
