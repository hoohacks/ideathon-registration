/**
 * Persistence for a schedule preview an organizer is still hand-editing.
 *
 * Building a schedule and then reworking room and judge assignments by hand
 * can take ten minutes. Without somewhere to put the in-progress plan, a
 * closed laptop lid or a stray reload threw all of it away. `/scheduleDraft`
 * is a single top-level node that holds exactly one draft at a time -- the
 * one currently open in the preview.
 *
 * `/scheduleDraft` gets no entry in database.rules.json, on purpose. It
 * inherits the root rule's admin-only .read/.write, same as every other path
 * nobody has written a narrower rule for. A rule scoped to this path could
 * only ever be equal or looser than that, and the unpublished schedule --
 * who is judging which team, before it is announced -- is exactly the kind
 * of thing that must not leak to a signed-in judge or competitor. So: no
 * rule, no republish, and reviewers should not add one here.
 *
 * `edits` is the one field that changes shape crossing the wire. In memory
 * (planSchedule.js, applyEdit.js) it is an ordered array. Realtime Database
 * never stores an array -- this codebase's rule is that sets are keyed, so a
 * single entry can be addressed and deleted without renumbering the rest.
 * `saveDraft` keys it on the way out with zero-padded indices ("0000",
 * "0001", ...), and `readDraft`/`subscribeDraft` sort those keys back into
 * the array `applyEdit` expects. `schedule.judges` inside each assignment is
 * the one array this codebase does keep, because it is the same shape
 * already written to teams/{id}/schedule -- except when it is empty:
 * `moveTeam` can legitimately place a team with `judges: []` before anyone is
 * assigned, and RTDB drops an empty array on write the same way it drops an
 * empty object, leaving the key entirely absent on the way back. `decodeDraft`
 * restores that key (and `assignments`, `basis.batchTimes`, and an edit's
 * `before.judges`, which can all go empty the same way) in one place, so
 * every downstream reader can assume they are always present.
 *
 * `saveDraft` is optimistic-concurrency: two organizers can have the preview
 * open at once, and the second save should not silently clobber the first.
 * It reads the stored version, refuses if it does not match the version the
 * caller last read, and names who moved it. The same check covers a draft
 * that was cleared out from under an editor: a plan carrying a version above
 * 0 with nothing currently stored did not just start existing, so that save
 * is refused rather than treated as a fresh first save.
