/**
 * Has the event moved since the final round was planned?
 *
 * The split that matters is blocking versus advisory. Blocking means publishing
 * would write something nobody reviewed, and it comes with a repair so an
 * organizer does not have to rebuild and lose their edits. Advisory is shown
 * and published anyway.
 *
 * The score check is the one to get right, and it is checked across every
 * *ranked* team rather than just the finalists: a card landing on the team just
 * below the cut line changes that team's average, not any finalist's, and can
 * lift it above one. Nothing about the finalist list looks wrong in that case,
 * which is exactly why it has to be caught here.
