/**
 * A durable outbox for score cards that could not reach the database.
 *
 * The Realtime Database SDK buffers writes in memory when it is offline, but
 * `await set(...)` does not resolve until the server acknowledges. So an
 * offline judge previously saw "Submitting…" forever, with no timeout and no
 * way to tell whether the score had landed — and a refresh at that point threw
 * the buffered write away silently. That is a lost score, discovered when the
 * results are tallied and a team is short a judge.
 *
 * Here the write gets a deadline. If it is not acknowledged in time, or fails
 * outright, the card lands in this queue on disk and the judge is told it is
 * saved and will sync. It survives a refresh, a crash, and a flat battery.
 *
 * This module deliberately knows nothing about Firebase: the writer is passed
 * in. That keeps the retry logic testable without a network or an emulator.
