/**
 * Has the event moved since the final round was planned?
 *
 * `checkDrift.js` for the final round. Same split: **blocking** drift means
 * publishing would write something nobody reviewed, and comes with a targeted
 * repair so an organizer does not have to rebuild and lose their edits;
 * **advisory** drift is shown and publishes anyway.
 *
 * The score check is the one that matters most and it is checked across every
 * *ranked* team, not just the finalists. A card landing on the team just below
 * the cut line changes that team's average, not any finalist's, and can lift it
 * above one. That is the dangerous half: a team that earned a place does not
 * get one, and nothing about the finalist list looks wrong.
 *
 * Pure.
