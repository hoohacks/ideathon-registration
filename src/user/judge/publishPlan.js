/**
 * Publishes a plan: the one place that replaces every judge and team
 * assignment in a live event.
 *
 * `planSchedule` builds a plan with no writes, so an organizer can review and
 * hand-edit it in the preview before anything is saved. This is the other
 * half -- it takes that plan, refuses anything that is not safe to write, and
 * then writes it all in one atomic update.
 *
 * Order matters:
 *   1. Confirm the caller is an admin -- a guard rail, not the boundary; the
 *      root rule in database.rules.json is what actually stops a non-admin.
 *   2. Refuse an empty plan, or one with a team that has no judges. A moveTeam
 *      edit is allowed to place a previously unscheduled team with an empty
 *      panel -- that is deliberate, so an organizer can drop a team into a
 *      room before assigning judges. Publishing one would send a team to a
 *      room nobody is coming to, so this is caught here, before anything is
 *      touched.
 *   3. Re-read the world and compare it to the plan's basis. Any blocking
 *      drift -- a team or judge that moved since the plan was built -- refuses
 *      the publish rather than write a schedule that is quietly wrong.
 *   4. Take a restore point of everything about to be replaced. If it cannot
 *      be taken, abandon -- a wipe with no restore point is exactly what that
 *      module exists to prevent.
 *   5. Write everything -- every judge's derived copy, every team's slot, the
 *      schedule metadata, the audit entry, and the cleared draft -- in ONE
 *      multi-path update, so a dropped connection cannot land some of it
 *      without the rest.
 *
 * Returns { ok, error?, drift?, snapshotId? }. Never throws.
