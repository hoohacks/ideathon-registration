/**
 * The result of the event.
 *
 * There was no screen for this. The standings were written at activation, never
 * read, and carried the first round's averages -- so the only way to find out
 * who won was to export the final round's raw cards and add them up. On the one
 * night of the year it matters, with a room waiting.
 *
 * The page is deliberately careful about one distinction: a ranking with cards
 * outstanding is a running total, not a result. The first row is always
 * somebody, because the tiebreak is a total order -- but announcing them while
 * a judge has not pressed submit is the mistake this page exists to prevent.
