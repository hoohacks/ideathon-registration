 * drops nulls on write. A path that did not exist when the snapshot was
 * taken is encoded as the literal string "null", and `JSON.parse("null")`
 * correctly comes back as `null` -- there is no special case for that below,
 * the ordinary "not an object, so it has no keys" handling already does the
 * right thing: everything live under that path shows up as removed.
