/**
 * The restore point list, rendered with a point in it.
 *
 * The page smoke test renders the whole control panel against a stubbed
 * database that returns nothing, so `points` is always empty there and the row
 * body never runs. That blind spot is how this section shipped rendering an
 * entire copy of the Registration Metrics page inside every row: the timestamp
 * was `<RegisteredAtDisplay value={point.at} />`, and RegisteredAtDisplay is
 * the metrics *page*, which takes no props, renders its own Layout and header,
 * and opens its own /competitors subscription.
 *
 * These render with a point present, which is the only state where that is
 * visible. The Preview dialog gets its own coverage below: it is what stands
 * between "Restore" and actually overwriting live data, so what it shows --
 * and what it falls back to when the judges read fails -- is worth pinning.
