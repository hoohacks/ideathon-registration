/**
 * Everything about one team's slot: which batch and room it sits in, and who
 * is judging it.
 *
 * Unlike the other edit drawers in this app, nothing here is staged behind a
 * single Save -- each control is its own `onEdit` dispatch, because the
 * organizer's own next move usually depends on what the last one did (place
 * a team, then immediately add its judges). The one exception is the
 * batch/room pair, which borrows `EditDrawer`'s own Save button (relabelled
 * "Apply") gated on whether the pair actually differs from where the team
 * sits now -- pressing Apply with nothing changed would still write a
 * (no-op) `moveTeam` edit and clutter the undo history for nothing.
 *
 * `onEdit(op)` is `SchedulePreview`'s single edit pipeline: it runs `op`
 * through `applyEdit` and, on success, saves the result. It resolves to the
 * `applyEdit` shape (`{ ok, error?, conflict? }`) -- `ok: false` here means
 * the edit itself was refused, and this drawer is the only place that shows
 * it. A `saveDraft` refusal (the draft moved under the organizer) is a
 * different failure than SchedulePreview surfaces on the page Snackbar
 * instead, since by then the live subscription has already replaced the plan
 * this drawer is looking at.
