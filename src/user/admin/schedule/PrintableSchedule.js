/**
 * The schedule on paper, one sheet per room.
 *
 * The README already treats "a judge scored on paper" as an ordinary event-day
 * occurrence and there is a Record score flow for it -- but nothing printed, so
 * the paper fallback started with somebody copying a screen by hand. When the
 * wifi in Rice Hall does what wifi does, the thing that keeps judging running is
 * a sheet per room listing the batch, the time, the team and the panel.
 *
 * A room is the unit rather than a batch, because a judge stays in a room and
 * teams rotate through it: one sheet, taped to one door, covers the whole
 * evening for whoever is in there.
 *
 * Print styling lives in `@media print` at the bottom rather than in the theme:
 * this is the only page that has a paper form, and everything a screen needs --
 * the app chrome, the print button itself -- is exactly what paper does not.
