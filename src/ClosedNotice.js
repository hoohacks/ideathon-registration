 * What the public sees before registration opens.

 * The site goes live weeks before the event does, so for most of its life the
 * honest thing for it to say is "not yet". This says when, and where to go in
 * the meantime, rather than presenting a form that would not work or a page
 * that looks broken.
 *
 * It is deliberately the same shell as the forms it replaces: somebody who
 * comes back on the day should recognise the page, not wonder whether they are
 * on the right site.
