/**
 * What to show when a page throws.
 *
 * React unmounts the whole tree when a render throws and nothing catches it, so
 * without this the result is a white page. That is the worst possible failure
 * mode for this app, because a blank page is also what a wrong URL looks like,
 * and what a page rendered below the fold looks like -- three different problems
 * with one symptom and no way to tell them apart from the outside.
 *
 * This does not try to recover. It says something broke, offers the two things
 * that actually help (reload, or go back to the dashboard), and shows the error
 * so it can be reported by someone who is not going to open the console.
