/**
 * The route guard.
 *
 * This is the component every authenticated page in the app is wrapped in, and
 * it had no tests. Note what it is and is not: it decides what *renders*, not
 * what a person can *read*. Anyone can set `userTypes` in DevTools and paint an
 * admin page; the database rules are what keep it empty. These tests cover the
 * navigation behaviour, including the loading gate that exists to fix a real
 * bug — without it a signed-in user was briefly treated as signed out and
 * bounced to /login on every refresh.
