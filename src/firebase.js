 * The emulator namespace, which is NOT derived from firebaseConfig.
 *
 * This is the subtle part. `connectDatabaseEmulator` keeps the namespace from
 * the configured databaseURL, so it would connect to a namespace called
 * `ideathon-2026-d6950-default-rtdb` on the emulator -- a real, empty database
 * that is not the one the seed script and the rules suite use. Reads then
 * succeed and return nothing, which looks exactly like a signed-in user with no
 * roles and is thoroughly confusing to debug.
 *
 * Passing the URL to getDatabase instead pins the namespace explicitly.
 *
 * It must be the project's DEFAULT instance -- `<projectId>-default-rtdb` --
 * and not the bare project id, because that is the only namespace
 * `firebase emulators:exec` applies database.rules.json to. A namespace the
 * emulator has no rules for is created on demand and left WIDE OPEN, so the
 * whole app ran locally with no authorization at all: every read succeeded,
 * every write succeeded, and a rules bug was invisible until production.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. `joinTeam` read two paths the rules refuse and
 * failed for every real user, while working perfectly against the emulator.
 *
 * scripts/seed-event.mjs writes the same namespace. Keep the two in step.
