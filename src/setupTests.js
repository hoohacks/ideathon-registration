// The public forms are gated by a build-time flag that defaults to CLOSED, so a
// production build that forgets it keeps strangers out. Tests are development,
// not production: they render the forms, so the doors are open here for the

//
// `registrationWindow.test.js` overrides this deliberately, with resetModules,
// to prove which way the flag fails.
